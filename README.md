# üõ°Ô∏è Custom Threat Intelligence Feed for FortiGate

Welcome to your custom threat feed! This repository hosts a plain text file (`blacklist.txt`) containing malicious IP addresses, hostnames, or URLs that you want to block at your firewall.

This feed is designed to be **used directly by FortiGate firewalls** via the External Threat Feed feature. Once configured, FortiGate will **pull the file on a regular interval** and automatically block traffic to any destination listed in the feed.
